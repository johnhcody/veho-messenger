Features yet to be complete for a full MVP
 - Text on the index of users should have the ~20 characters of the last conversation
 - Currently the New Conversation Button does not have the desired effect (it is a dead button)
 - When creating a new message, the old message is deleted
 - styling within the textarea of the form
